# Hi there 👋

## 🧬 About Me

I'm a student at UT Austin in the Turing Scholars program, passionate about math, computer science, physics, and research.  
My interests include:
- 🧠 Mechanistic interpretability of transformers
- 🔐 Post-quantum cryptography and secure communications
- 📊 Agentic AI
- ⚙️ Building useful tools

## Notable Public Projects

Affine Recurrence Mechanistic Interpretability Research - Code for https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17438, research done under the Non-Trivial Fellowship.

Fin-assist - A voice-agent financial hotline that provides soothing voice assistance, emotional crisis detection, and financial literacy education.

23-24 Science Fair - Using ML to predict highly efficient Hydrogen Evolution Reaction catalysts. Testing physically or using Quantum DFT calculations takes far longer (weeks+), and using this code, my team identified catalysts better than platinum, the current industry standard.

IMC Prosperity - My team and I participated in the IMC Trading competition for the first time this year. This repository contains all of our probing, testing, and submission code.

ucf-pairs-trading - Utilized pairs-trading on cointegrated stocks to find a profitable strategy. Our hedge ratio on VLO and TSLA yielded a Sharpe ratio of 1.42 over the past year.

Diabetic Guard - A free, accessible app that monitors, analyzes, and stores glucose levels data for prediabetics and people with diabetes
